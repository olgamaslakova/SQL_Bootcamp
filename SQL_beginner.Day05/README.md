# Day 05 — SQL Bootcamp

## _I improved my SQL Query! Please, provide proof!_

Resume: Today you will see how and when to create database indexes


## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of pizzeria
- field rating — average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of person
- field age — age of person
- field gender — gender of person
- field address — address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name — name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price — price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field menu_id — foreign key to menu
- field order_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and in that time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.


## Exercise 00 — Let’s create indexes for every foreign key

| Exercise 00: Let’s create indexes for every foreign key |                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex00                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day05_ex00.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |

Please create a simple BTree index for each foreign key in our database. The name pattern should match the next rule "idx_{table_name}_{column_name}". For example, the name of the BTree index for the pizzeria_id column in the `menu` table is `idx_menu_pizzeria_id`.



## Exercise 01 — How to see that index works?

| Exercise 01: How to see that index works?|                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex01                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day05_ex01.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |

Before proceeding, please write an SQL statement that returns pizzas and the corresponding pizzeria names. See the example result below (no sorting required).

| pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ |
| cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... |

Let's prove that your indexes work for your SQL.
The sample proof is the output of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command. 
Please take a look at the sample output of the command.
    
    ...
    ->  Index Scan using idx_menu_pizzeria_id on menu m  (...)
    ...

**Hint**: Please think about why your indexes do not work in a direct way and what should we do to enable it?




## Exercise 02 — Formula is in the index. Is it Ok?

| Exercise 02: Formula is in the index. Is it Ok?|                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex02                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day05_ex02.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |

Please create a functional B-Tree index  named `idx_person_name` on the column name of the `person` table. The index should contain person names in upper case. 

Write and provide any SQL with proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that index idx_person_name works.


## Exercise 03 — Multicolumn index for our goals

| Exercise 03: Multicolumn index for our goals |                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex03                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day05_ex03.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |


Please create a better multi-column B-Tree index named `idx_person_order_multi` for the SQL statement below.

    SELECT person_id, menu_id,order_date
    FROM person_order
    WHERE person_id = 8 AND menu_id = 19;


The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command should return the next pattern. Please pay attention to "Index Only Scan" scanning!

    Index Only Scan using idx_person_order_multi on person_order ...

Provide any SQL with proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that index `idx_person_order_multi` works.

Please create a partially unique BTree index named `idx_person_order_order_date` on the `person_order` table for the `person_id` and `menu_id` attributes with partial uniqueness for the `order_date` column for the date '2022-01-01'.

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command should return the next pattern.

    Index Only Scan using idx_person_order_order_date on person_order …


## Exercise 06 — Let’s make performance improvement


| Exercise 06: Let’s make performance improvement|                                                                                                                          |

Take a look at the SQL below from a technical perspective (ignore a logical case of this SQL statement).

    SELECT
        m.pizza_name AS pizza_name,
        max(rating) OVER (PARTITION BY rating ORDER BY rating ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS k
    FROM  menu m
    INNER JOIN pizzeria pz ON m.pizzeria_id = pz.id
    ORDER BY 1,2;

Create a new BTree index named `idx_1` that should improve the "Execution Time" metric of this SQL. Provide evidence (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that the SQL has been improved.

**Hint**: This exercise looks like a "brute force" task to find a good cover index, so before your new test, remove the `idx_1` index.
