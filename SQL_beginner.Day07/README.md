# Day 07 — SQL Bootcamp

## _Aggregated data is more informative, isn't it?_

Resume: Today you will see how to use specific OLAP constructions to get a "Value" from data.


## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access to it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during Exercises 07-13 and in Day04 during Exercise 07 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of pizzeria
- field rating — average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of person
- field age — age of person
- field gender — gender of person
- field address — address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name — name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price — price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field menu_id — foreign key to menu
- field order_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and at the same time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

| Language                        | ANSI SQL|

Let's make a simple aggregation, please write a SQL statement that returns person identifiers and corresponding number of visits in any pizzerias and sorts by number of visits in descending mode and sorts by `person_id` in ascending mode. Please take a look at the sample of data below.

| person_id | count_of_visits |
| ------ | ------ |
| 9 | 4 |
| 4 | 3 |
| ... | ... |

Please modify an SQL statement from Exercise 00 and return a person name (not an identifier). Additional clause is we need to see only top 4 people with maximum visits in each pizzerias and sorted by a person name. See the example of output data below.

| ------ | ------ |
| Dmitriy | 4 |
| Denis | 3 |

Please write a SQL statement to see 3 favorite restaurants by visits and by orders in a list (please add an action_type column with values 'order' or 'visit', it depends on the data from the corresponding table). Please have a look at the example data below. The result should be sorted in ascending order by the action_type column and in descending order by the count column.

| name | count | action_type |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Dominos | 6 | order |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Dominos | 7 | visit |

Write an SQL statement to see how restaurants are grouped by visits and by orders, and joined together by restaurant name.  
You can use the internal SQL from Exercise 02 (Restaurants by Visits and by Orders) without any restrictions on the number of rows.

In addition, add the following rules.
- Compute a sum of orders and visits for the corresponding pizzeria (note that not all pizzeria keys are represented in both tables).
- Sort the results by the `total_count` column in descending order and by the `name` column in ascending order.
Take a look at the example data below.

| name | total_count |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dominos | 13 |
| DinoPizza | 9 |
| ... | ... |

We know personal addresses from our data. Let's assume that this person only visits pizzerias in his city. Write a SQL statement that returns the address, the name of the pizzeria, and the amount of the person's orders. The result should be sorted by address and then by restaurant name. Please take a look at the sample output data below.

| address | name |count_of_orders |
| ------ | ------ |------ |
| Kazan | Best Pizza |4 |
| Kazan | DinoPizza |4 |
| ... | ... | ... |

Please write a SQL statement that returns aggregated information by person's address, the result of "Maximum Age - (Minimum Age / Maximum Age)" presented as a formula column, next is average age per address and the result of comparison between formula and average columns (in other words, if formula is greater than average, then True, otherwise False value).

The result should be sorted by address column. Please take a look at the example of output data below.

| address | formula |average | comparison |
| ------ | ------ |------ |------ |
| Kazan | 44.71 |30.33 | true |
| Moscow | 20.24 | 18.5 | true |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
