# Day 03 — SQL Bootcamp

## _Continuing to JOIN and make change in data_

Resume: Today you will see how to change data based on DML language.


## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at this section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of pizzeria
- field rating — average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of person
- field age — age of person
- field gender — gender of person
- field address — address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name — name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price — price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field menu_id — foreign key to menu
- field order_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Find a union of pizzerias that have orders from either women or men. In other words, you should find a set of names of pizzerias that have been ordered only by women and make "UNION" operation with set of names of pizzerias that have been ordered only by men. Please be careful with word "only" for both genders. For all SQL operators with sets don't store duplicates (`UNION`, `EXCEPT`, `INTERSECT`).  Please sort a result by the name of the pizzeria. The sample data is shown below.


| pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | 
| Papa Johns |
